# Coding problems

In this repo I will keep collecting all the challenges and online competitions that I participate and solve.

The solutions are present in the 'archive' directory.

Am saving extra files like contents of the .idea, main, test folders as those are a pain to set up each time when I move into a new environment.

**This project is using CHelper and Yaal developed be EgorK.**
